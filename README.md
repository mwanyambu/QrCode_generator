Features
Generate unique QR codes for card owners.
Automatically save QR codes as images.
Store card owner details such as name, email, phone number, hostel name, and room number.
Easily manage card owner data through the Django Admin interface.

Key Functionalities
1. QR Code Generation
The QR code is generated using the qrcode library and stored in the media/qr_codes/ directory. Each QR code encodes the card owner's details in the following format:

plaintext
Copy code
Name: John Doe
Email: john.doe@example.com
Phone: 123-456-7890
Hostel: ABC Hostel
Room: 101
2. Django Admin
Easily manage card owner data through the Django Admin interface at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin.
Security Notes
Media Files:

Media files, such as QR codes, are saved in the media/ directory.

To prevent media files from being pushed to GitHub, ensure the following entry is in your .gitignore file:

bash
Copy code
/media/
Secret Key:

Do not expose your SECRET_KEY in production. Use environment variables or a .env file.
Future Improvements
Add user authentication to restrict access to certain features.
Implement REST APIs for external integration.
Enhance the frontend with a modern framework like React or Vue.js.
Add support for bulk QR code generation.
